We’re going to complete the tasks in this tutorial using GitHub.com, so you don’t have to know the command line or even install Git (which is the change-tracking software GitHub is built on). 

You don’t even need to know how to code. 

You will, however, need a GitHub account, so sign up if you don’t have one!
